/*Develop a Java program to create a class PLAYER with member variables name,matches_played and average. This class has an abstract method cal_average(String,int,int).
Derive two classes BATSMAN and BOWLER from PLAYER. Class BATSMAN has amember variable runs_scored. Class BOWLER has a member variable runs_given. Create mBATSMAN objects and n BOWLER objects. Calculate and display the average runs scored
by each BATSMAN and average runs given by each BOWLER.*/
